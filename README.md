# CYBERSECURITY-THREAT-DETECTION-PLATFORM-USING-ML
This project is an AI-powered real-time cybersecurity threat detection system that:  Captures network traffic using Wireshark's TShark API.  Analyzes packets with machine learning (Random Forest model).  Detects and classifies packets as SAFE or THREAT.  Visualizes real-time network activity using OpenCV.
